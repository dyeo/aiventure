# aiventure

**aiventure** (pronounced AI-venture) is an attempt at creating an entirely open-source, GPT-2-based AI text adventure game.
aiventure seeks to meet the following goals during its development:

1. A user-friendly UI that provides all of the editing capabilities required of a game of this type.
2. The ability to (optionally) offload AI calculations to a compute cluster (i.e. Google colab).
3. Full modding support, including a well-documented API.
4. A custom-tuned - possibly community-soruced - GPT-2 model that can handle most all settings and story paces.

These goals are more-or-less in chronological order. Some more minor and potentially optional goals of this project include:

- Shrinking the usable model's memory footprint down to a size manageable by most consumer graphics cards.
- Providing cross-platform and mobile support.
- Custom-tailored models for different settings.
- Open-source multiplayer.
